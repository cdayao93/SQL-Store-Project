# SQL-Store-Project
Design a store database

Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository of SQL Store, a specialized store project designed as a demonstration of my data analysis and SQL skills. This project encapsulates the creation and management of a retail store's inventory database. I have chosen to specialize in a mixed variety such as clothing, electronics, and Home and Kitchen and have tailored the database to reflect the unique aspects of this market segment.

Features
Specialized Inventory: A curated collection of over 15 unique items.
Database Design: A comprehensive SQL table, including columns such as ItemID, Category, Name, Price, and QuantityInStock.
Data Queries: Advanced SQL SELECT statements to efficiently order items by price and extract meaningful statistics about the inventory.

Project Structure
inventory.sql: Contains the SQL commands for creating the inventory table and inserting the item data.
queries.sql: Includes the SQL queries used to organize items by price and analyze the inventory data.
statistics.md: A markdown file presenting the key statistics and insights derived from the data.

Installation
No installation is required to view the project files. To use the SQL files, a SQL-compatible database system like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite is needed.

Usage
The repository is divided into sections for easy understanding and navigation:

Database Creation: Run the inventory.sql script to create your inventory database and tables.

Data Analysis: Execute the queries.sql script to view how data can be sorted and meaningful insights extracted.

Insights and Statistics: Refer to the statistics.md for a detailed analysis of the inventory data.

Insights
Key statistics derived from the data, such as the average price of items, total value of inventory, most stocked category, etc.
Trends and patterns observed from the data analysis.
Potential Enhancements
Integration with a front-end interface for a more interactive user experience.
Implementation of a real-time stock update feature.
